    Clusters (x,y) points by checking each new point only against
    the most recently created cluster.
    
    Algorithm:
    1. First point â†’ first cluster (center = that point).
    2. For each subsequent point:
       - Compare distance to the center of the 'latest' cluster only.
       - If distance < threshold, add point to that cluster and update center.
       - Otherwise, create a new cluster with this point as its center.
